# Pelicase-Cyberdeck
Inspired by Jay Doscher awesome work : https://doscher.com/

Cyberdeck made around Pelicases 1150 and 1300, here are custom keyboard PCB files, cad files, firmware,etc.

CAD files may be over-engineered but are made to fit a Prusa mini+ (180x180mm, print diagonally the longest ones))
